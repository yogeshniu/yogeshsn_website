# Chinese Language Tutorial - Part 6

## Word Order in a Chinese Sentence

A Chinese sentence typically follows the subject-predicate structure, where the subject, often a noun or pronoun, precedes the predicate, typically a verb or adjective. For example:
- Sub + Predicate:   
- *tā shì lǎoshī.*
- *pǔruì shi liúxuéshēng.*
- *tā hěn piàoliang.*

## Sentence Making

Use the given words to create sentences:
- zhè bǐ shì ____________ (This pen is ____________.)
- shū xīn hěn ____________ (The book is _____________.)
- zhōngguórén tā shì ____________ (Chinese, he/she is ___________.)

## The Attributive and Structural Particle “的”

When indicating possession, the particle “的” is inserted between the attributive and the qualified object. For example:
- *wǒ de shū* (my book)
- *pǔruì de cídiǎn* (Pradeep's dictionary)

However, when the personal pronoun refers to family or friendship relations, the possessive particle “的” is often omitted. For instance:
- *wǒ bàba* (my dad)
- *tāmen bān* (our class)

When a noun indicates the characteristic or quality of the object, it usually doesn't take “的” after it. For example:
- *déguó rén* (German people)
- *hànyǔ shū* (Chinese language book)

## Sentences with Adjectival Predicate

A sentence with an adjectival predicate doesn't necessarily require the verb “是” in the predicate. Examples:
- *tā hěn cōngming.* (He/She is very smart.)
- *wǒ de shū hěn xīn.* (My book is very new.)

When “很” is not used as an adverb, the adjective often implies comparison. For example:
- *wǒmen bān de jiàoshì dà, tāmen bān de jiàoshì xiǎo.* (Our classroom is big; theirs is small.)
