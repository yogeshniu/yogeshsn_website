### **1. Understand the Task**
Before you begin writing:  
- Spend 2–3 minutes analyzing the graph.  
- Identify **time periods**, **trends (increase, decrease, stability)**, and **notable data points (peaks, lows, significant changes)**.  
- Ask yourself: *What is the general story of the graph?*

---

### **2. Structure of the Response**
Your essay should follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**  
2. **Overview (most important trends and general patterns)**  
3. **Detailed Paragraph 1 (first key trends)**  
4. **Detailed Paragraph 2 (remaining key trends)**  

---

### **3. Sentence Starters and Vocabulary Ideas**

#### **A. Introduction**  
The introduction should describe what the graph is about. Use **paraphrasing** to avoid copying words from the question.  
- **Sentence Starters:**  
  - The graph/chart illustrates...  
  - The line graph provides information about...

  - The line graph shows trends in participation across various activities over two decades.

#### **B. Overview**  
The overview highlights **major trends** or patterns without giving specific numbers. Look for:  
1. **The biggest/most popular category.**

- **Sentence Starters for Overviews:**  
  - Overall, it is clear that...

Provide detailed comparisons and describe changes for different categories. Divide the trends into **two paragraphs** based on logical groupings: e.g., rising trends vs. falling trends.

- **Sentence Starters for Describing Trends:**  
  - **To describe increases:**  
    - The number of participants rose steadily from... to...  
    - Participation in [activity] increased significantly, reaching a peak of...  
    - There was a sharp/gradual rise in...  

  - **To describe decreases:**  
    - The number of participants in [activity] fell significantly from... to...  
    - A steady decline was observed in...  
    - Participation dropped sharply...  

  - **To describe stability:**  
    - The figures remained relatively stable at around...  
    - There was little change in the number of participants...  
    - Participation in [activity] plateaued throughout the period...  

  - **To describe fluctuations:**  
    - The trend fluctuated over the period, with highs of... and lows of...

    - By contrast, [activity] showed a completely different trend...  
    - While [activity A] increased, [activity B] experienced a decline...  

- **Example (Body Paragraph 1 - Rising Trends):**  
  - Participation in table tennis showed a steady rise throughout the period. It began at around 20 participants in 2000 and remained stable for the next decade. However, from 2010 onwards, it experienced consistent growth, reaching 53 participants by 2020, making it the second most popular activity. Similarly, musical performances, which started with zero participants in 2000, saw gradual growth over the years, peaking at 15 by the end of 2020.  

- **Example (Body Paragraph 2 - Declining and Stable Trends):**  
  - In contrast, amateur dramatics witnessed a sharp decline. Starting with 25 participants in 2000, the numbers fell by 80% to just 5 by 2020. Martial arts, on the other hand, remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 31 and 36 participants over the two decades. Despite these fluctuations, the closing figure in 2020 was 35, almost the same as the initial value in 2000.
