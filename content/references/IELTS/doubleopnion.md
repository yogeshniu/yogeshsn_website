3. Provide examples or evidence to support this perspective.  
4. Acknowledge any limitations of this view (optional).  

**Example:**  
Supporters of competition argue that it motivates individuals to push their limits and achieve excellence. For example, students competing for top grades often work harder and develop valuable skills such as time management and perseverance. Similarly, in the corporate world, competition among businesses fosters innovation and higher-quality products for consumers. However, excessive competition may lead to stress and unhealthy comparisons, potentially harming mental well-being.
