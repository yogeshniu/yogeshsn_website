This guide provides a detailed explanation of how to solve optimization problems using the SCIP library in Python. SCIP is a powerful tool that can handle linear, non-linear, and integer programming problems.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download and Install SCIP**:
   - Visit the [SCIP download page](https://scipopt.org/download.php?fname=SCIPOptSuite-9.1.0-win64-VS15.exe).
   - Fill out the required form to download the application.
   - Install the downloaded application on your computer.

2. **Install PySCIPOpt**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install the PySCIPOpt package:
     ```bash
     pip install pyscipopt
     ```

### Example Problem: Maximizing an Objective Function

In this example, we will maximize an objective function subject to certain constraints using the SCIP library.

#### Step-by-Step Solution with SCIP

#### Step 1: Import the PySCIPOpt Library
First, import the necessary module from PySCIPOpt:
```python
from pyscipopt import Model
```

#### Step 2: Create a Model
Create a model object. Here, we name our model "Vedula_2.2.2":
```python
model = Model('Vedula_2.2.2')
```

#### Step 3: Define Variables
Define the decision variables for the problem. We create two variables, `x` and `y`, with lower bounds of 0:
```python
x = model.addVar('x', lb=0)
y = model.addVar('y', lb=0)
```

#### Step 4: Set the Objective Function
Set the objective function that we want to maximize. In this example, the objective function is `3*x + 4*y`. The `sense` parameter is set to 'maximize' to indicate that we want to maximize this function:
```python
model.setObjective(3 * x + 4 * y, sense='maximize')
```

#### Step 5: Add Constraints
Add the constraints to the model. Constraints are the conditions that the solution must satisfy:
```python
model.addCons(5 * x + y >= 45)   # Constraint 1
model.addCons(3 * x + 5 * y <= 72)  # Constraint 2
model.addCons(2 * x + y <= 24)   # Constraint 3
```

#### Step 6: Optimize the Model
Optimize the model to find the best solution that maximizes the objective function while satisfying all the constraints:
```python
model.optimize()
```

#### Step 7: Retrieve and Print the Solution
Retrieve the best solution found by the solver and print the values of the variables `x` and `y`:
```python
sol = model.getBestSol()
print(sol)
```

### Complete Code

Here is the complete code with all the steps:
```python
# First: pip install pyscipopt
from pyscipopt import Model

# Create the model
model = Model('Vedula_2.2.2')

# Define the variables with their bounds
x = model.addVar('x', lb=0)
y = model.addVar('y', lb=0)

# Set the objective function to maximize
model.setObjective(3 * x + 4 * y, sense='maximize')

# Add the constraints
model.addCons(5 * x + y >= 45)   # Constraint 1
model.addCons(3 * x + 5 * y <= 72)  # Constraint 2
model.addCons(2 * x + y <= 24)   # Constraint 3

# Optimize the model
model.optimize()

# Retrieve and print the solution
sol = model.getBestSol()
print(sol)
```


This script demonstrates how to use the SCIP library to solve an optimization problem. By following these steps, you can define variables, set constraints, specify an objective function, and find the optimal solution using SCIP. This is a powerful tool for solving various optimization problems in fields such as operations research, economics, and engineering.
