According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection%E2%80%93diffusion_equation), The convection窶電iffusion equation is a combination of the diffusion and convection (advection) equations, and describes physical phenomena where particles, energy, or other physical quantities are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes: diffusion and convection. Depending on context, the same equation can be called the advection窶電iffusion equation, drift窶電iffusion equation, or (generic) scalar transport equation

*The derivation of the advection窶電iffusion equation is based on the An Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics THE FINITE VOLUME METHOD
