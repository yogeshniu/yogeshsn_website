### Common Types of Boundary Conditions in CFD

Boundary conditions in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are crucial for defining how fluid interacts with its environment at the domain boundaries. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of the common boundary conditions:

#### 1. **Inlet Boundary Condition**
- **What It Does**: Specifies how fluid enters the computational domain.
- **Types**:
  - **Velocity Inlet**: Defines the speed or flow rate at which fluid enters.
  - **Pressure Inlet**: Sets the pressure at the inlet when the flow rate is unknown.
- **Importance**: The choice between velocity or pressure inlet affects the flow's energy and momentum distribution.

#### 2. **Outlet Boundary Condition**
- **What It Does**: Describes how fluid exits the domain.
- **Types**:
  - **Zero-Diffusion Flux**: Assumes the flow conditions at the outlet are extrapolated from within the domain.
  - **Pressure Outlet**: Sets the pressure at the outlet, useful for complex flow situations or multiple exits.
- **Importance**: Ensures stable and accurate results, especially for flows with backpressure or recirculation.

#### 3. **Wall Boundary Condition**
- **What It Does**: Governs the interaction between fluid and solid surfaces.
- **Types**:
  - **No-Slip Condition**: Assumes fluid at the wall has zero relative velocity (sticking to the wall).
  - **Wall Function**: Used in turbulent flows where direct modeling of near-wall regions is impractical.
- **Importance**: Critical for accurate modeling of friction, heat transfer, and shear forces at walls.

#### 4. **Symmetry Boundary Condition**
- **What It Does**: Utilizes the symmetry of the problem to reduce computational effort.
- **Types**:
  - **Mirror Symmetry**: Reflects the solution across a plane, reducing the domain size.
  - **Rotational Symmetry**: Reduces a 3D problem to 2D by revolving the solution around an axis.
- **Importance**: Significantly decreases computation time and resource requirements.

#### 5. **Periodic Boundary Condition**
- **What It Does**: Repeats the flow pattern across the domain boundaries.
- **Usage**: Ideal for flows that are repetitive in space (like turbine blades) or time (like pulsating flows).
- **Importance**: Allows for efficient simulation of large or repeating systems without modeling the entire domain.
