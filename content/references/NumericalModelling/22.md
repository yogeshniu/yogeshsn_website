### Inlet Boundary Conditions for a Velocity Component Perpendicular to the x-Direction

When dealing with inlet boundary conditions where the flow is perpendicular to the x-direction (i.e., the flow enters the domain in the y-direction), here's how you implement the conditions:

#### 1. **Grid Arrangement**
- **Location**: The grid at the inlet boundary extends outside the physical boundary. The nodes along the line $$ \( i = 1 \) (or \( i = 2 \) for \( u \)-velocity)$$  are used to store the inlet values of flow variables such as $$\( u_{\text{in}} \), \( v_{\text{in}} \), \( \phi_{\text{in}} \), and \( p_{\text{in}} \).$$

refer figure 9.2 for example.

#### 2. **Velocity Component**
- **U-Velocity**: For an inlet perpendicular to the x-direction, the $\( u \)$-velocity is\ specified at the inlet.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Velocity at the Inlet**: The inlet value for the $\( u \)-velocity, \( u_{\text{in}} \)$, is stored at the boundary node \( I = 1 \) or \( i = 2 \) (depending on the grid arrangement). 
  - **Internal Cells**: The solution for the first internal cell (shaded in diagrams) begins just downstream of this node.

#### 3. **Discretization of Equations**
- **U-Velocity and Scalar Variables**: The discretized equations for \( u \)-velocity and scalar variables remain unaffected at the boundary cells. All links to neighboring nodes remain active.

- **Pressure Correction Equation**:
  - **Boundary Condition**: For the pressure correction equation, the link to the boundary cell (west) is set to zero. Thus, the coefficient $\( a_W \)$ in the discretized equation is set to zero.
  - **Velocity Correction**: The velocity at the boundary is directly set as $\( u^*_W = u_W \)$, meaning no correction is needed at the inlet.

#### 4. **Pressure Reference**
- **Absolute Pressure**: To obtain an absolute pressure field, a reference pressure is often fixed at one inlet node. The pressure correction at this node is set to zero, providing a reference from which absolute pressures can be derived within the domain.

#### 5. **Turbulence Parameters**
- **Turbulent Kinetic Energy $\( k \)$ and Dissipation Rate $\( \epsilon \)$**: If measured values are unavailable, approximate formulae based on turbulence intensity (1% to 6%) and a length scale are used to estimate $\( k \) and \( \epsilon \)$ for the inlet conditions.
