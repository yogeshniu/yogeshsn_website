### Evolution of the Human Brain: From Primitive to Advanced (Kolb & Whishaw, 2011)

1. **The Brain Develops from the Inside Out**  
   - Human brain evolution and development follow a pattern where simpler structures evolved first, followed by more complex ones. This sequence reflects the gradual progression of life on Earth, from basic survival needs to higher-order thinking.

2. **The Brain Stem: The Oldest and Most Primitive Region**  
   - **Location**: Found at the base of the brain, connecting to the spinal column.  
   - **Functions**:
     - **Life-Sustaining Processes**: Responsible for essential functions like breathing, heart rate, and digestion.  
     - Acts as the foundation of the brain's architecture, ensuring survival by regulating automatic bodily functions.  
   - **Evolutionary Stage**: Corresponds to reptiles, highlighting its role in basic survival needs.

3. **The Limbic System: The Emotional and Reactive Center**  
   - **Location**: Positioned above the brain stem, combining parts of the cortex (folded outer layer) and subcortex (beneath the cortex).  
   - **Functions**:  
     - **Emotional Regulation**: Helps process and manage emotions, forming the brain’s "emotional core."  
     - **Reactive Responses**: Supports survival by quickly reacting to threats or opportunities.  
     - **Reward-Based Processing**: Encourages behaviors essential for survival, such as seeking food or avoiding danger.  
     - **Memory Support**: Aids in remembering details critical for future survival, like recognizing threats or beneficial environments.  
   - **Evolutionary Stage**: Developed with mammals, adding emotions and social bonds to survival strategies.

4. **The Cortex (Neocortex): The Rational and Thinking Brain**  
   - **Location**: The outermost, folded layer of the brain.  
   - **Functions**:  
     - **Sensory Integration**: Processes inputs from our senses, enabling us to perceive and interact with the world.  
     - **Executive Functioning**:
       - Planning and organizing actions or thoughts.
       - Shifting focus between tasks.
     - **Higher Thinking**:
       - Conscious reasoning and decision-making.
       - Self-awareness and metacognition (thinking about thinking).  
     - Represents the brain's ability to adapt, learn, and solve complex problems.  
   - **Evolutionary Stage**: Marks the transition to humans, enabling advanced behaviors, creativity, and cultural development.

5. **The Thalamus: The Brain’s Relay Station**  
   - **Location**: Central hub within the brain, situated among the limbic structures.  
   - **Functions**:  
     - **Information Relay**: Acts as the primary processing center for sensory information (except smell).  
     - **Coordination**: Ensures communication between the brain’s sensory, emotional, and rational areas.  
     - Plays a vital role in maintaining a unified experience of the world.

---

6. **An Evolutionary Journey**  
   - The development of brain regions mirrors the evolutionary path of life:  
     - **Reptiles** → Brain Stem: Focused on survival essentials.  
     - **Mammals** → Limbic System: Added emotions and social instincts.  
     - **Humans** → Neocortex: Enabled abstract thought, innovation, and culture.

---

7. **Parallel in Development After Conception**  
   - The human brain’s growth after conception also follows this inside-out pattern:
     - Brain stem forms first, ensuring survival functions.  
     - Limbic structures develop, supporting emotions and memory.  
     - Finally, the cortex grows, equipping the brain with higher cognitive abilities.  
   - This progression ensures that the foundational functions are in place before advanced capabilities emerge.

---

To summarize this theory of brain development, the functions of the
brain developed in sequential order: First came the core mechanisms that
keep us alive. Next came the primary emotional responses, reward processes,
and foundational memory to enhance survival of the individual in the environment. Third came conscious thought, executive functioning, and metacognition, which assist with regulating emotions, setting the world in context,
and thinking rationally. Thus capacity for rational thought does not precede
core physiological arousal or foundational emotion, memory, and behaviorally
reactive processes.
