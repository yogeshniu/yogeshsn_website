Here are five questions that you can use as assignments based on the concepts covered in our Python learning and tutorial:

1. **Data Handling with Pandas:**
   - Create a Pandas DataFrame from scratch with at least three columns (e.g., Hydropower_name, Hydropower_capacity, Location). Display the first five rows of the DataFrame.

2. **Data Analysis with Pandas:**
   - Load a CSV file containing student grades data (columns: StudentID, Subject, Grade). Compute and print the average grade for each subject.

3. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib:**
   - Generate a line plot using Matplotlib to visualize the trend of daily temperature (in Celsius) over a week. Assume you have a list of temperatures for each day.

4. **Hydraulic Calculations:**
   - Write a Python function that calculate the headloss for open flow. Use inputs for velocity, depth, width, and slope of channel. Assume rectangular channel and n= 0.0015.

5. **Hydropower Simulation:**
   - Implement a simulation using Python classes to model the operation of a hydropower reservoir over a period of one month. Include functions to update daily inflows, compute daily storage levels, and calculate daily hydropower output. You can assume fixed height for power calculation.

These questions cover various aspects of Python programming, data handling with Pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib, and specific applications in hydraulic engineering and hydropower. T
