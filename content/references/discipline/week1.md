# Monthly Plan for January 2024

This week is about to end. Today is January 6, 2024. I posted a message on January 1st highlighting the need for good planning, dedication, and hard work. In the final lines, I made a commitment to follow up with posts that would underscore my plans and activity lists, focusing on my dreams.

For this reason, I've come up with a subtle plan for this month, which aims to yield benefits in five major areas: **Physical Wellbeing, Mental Toughness, Spiritual Understanding, Social Connection, and Career Orientation**. My long-term goals include achieving great shape and a healthy body, acquiring engineering skills, and maintaining a well-balanced life.

So, for January, I am committed to:

## Physical Wellbeing
- Running a minimum of **50km**
- Completing **1200 pushups, sit-ups, squats, and other exercises**

## Mental Toughness
- Finishing **8 podcasts** this month (2 podcasts or 4 hours per week)
- Completing two books on my Kindle, requiring at least **30 minutes of reading each day**

## Spiritual Understanding
- Meditating for **20 minutes daily**

## Social Connection
- Abstaining from junk foods
- Reducing screen time, especially on social media
- Writing blogs, participating in webinars, and delving into research

## Career Orientation
- Maintaining a daily diary
- Waking up before sunrise
- Nurturing software skills
- Learning the Chinese language
- Considering completing a crash course in a random subject

It's a cold Saturday morning, marking the end of week 1. I've managed to run **13 km** and perform **200+ pushups, squats, sit-ups, and triceps dips**. I've learned some basics of business and management and am consistently attending my Chinese language class. This week, I worked on a proposal, marking a good beginning.

Although I couldn't meditate most days, I only managed to complete one podcast this week. I need to maintain my reading schedule for Kindle books as well. It was a tough week, yet a great beginning. So, I am determined to reach my targets and, for this, I need more planned monitoring and evaluation.

I will complete "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and meditate every day by next Saturday. Have a great time, and God bless you.
