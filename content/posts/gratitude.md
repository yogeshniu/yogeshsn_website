Gratitude can only bring us happiness and lighten the heaviness of our soul. I have wondered how I started and where I am going. Though I do not have answers of the past or the future, i believe in present. Therefore

**Today, I will live**

_I will enjoy the sunshine. I will feel the drizzle. I will listen to the birds, and I will smell the petals. I will be lost in blues and green for hours. I will be focused, attentive and present. I will enjoy now._

**Today, I will love.**
_I will radiate care and empathy. I will see things as a whole and i will feel them. I will forgive and I will acknowledge. I will feel your pains, and I will be you. I will stand in your shoes and pray for your wellbeing. For I know i am your part and I am the part of whole._

**Today, I will smile.**

*What on the earth or life, is greater than feeling light, moving happily and enjoying the company. I will put my life in creating happiness and bringing smiles. I know pain and fear are parts of my life. I accept them happily. I will feel the storm, i will learn to adapt and i will smile at the end. The pain of today is the treasure of tomorrow. I will smile and radiate peace.*

**Today, I will let go.**

*If it does good for me or others, i will be grateful. If it does no good, I will let it go. I know there are many possibilities and each paths have different destination. I will not hold on to the matter, that hurts my heart and stop my growth, i will be free from exhaustion and I will move on.*

**Today, I will forgive.**

*Forgiveness is my strength. I will forgive unconditionally, and I will pray for all wellbeing. And I will forgive myself. I will not put myself in the desert of useless thoughts. For i know, I have wings and I can reach the sky. I cannot change the way people behave towards me, but i can change the way I act under such scenarios. My choice creates my destiny.*

**Today, I will expect less.**

*I will try not to expect anything from anyone but me. I know everyone are fighting their fights and they are solving their own problems. If i can i will help them. I will love them for what they are. I will pray for their growth and happiness. However, i will put expectation with myself and act accordingly.*

**Today, I will act.**

_I have been long procrastinating, doing nothing but waiting tomorrow. But tomorrow has never arrived, and i have lived in the sea of regrets. But I will act now, row my boats and reach the land. All seconds are important, thus i will block my time for important things, and i will work hard. I know rest is a myth, freedom is a lie and discipline is a key. I will be discipline and unlock my potential._
_I will, therefore, not involve myself in the past, for it has gone. I will not try to change another individual for I know every life are different. I will accept their identity, but I will always be the one pointing the way, acknowledging their importance and making them aware for the good._

**Today, i will not blame.**

_Who am I to blame others for my wounds. I won’t blame them, and they cannot hurt me again. I will simply start for myself and end on myself. I am the cause for my life, and that is my truth. I always have a choice and i have acted according to my will. If I have done mistake, i will not indulge in that matter. I have already suffered and i have already regretted. I have forgiven myself and i have learned the hard lesson. I will not repeat my mistakes. If i do, i will bear consequences._

**Today, I will care my being.**

_For the nearly 5,000 sperm that make it into the utero-tubal junction, around 1,000 of these reach the inside of the Fallopian tube. -For the 1,000 sperm entering the tube, only around 200 actually reach the egg. -In the end, only 1 lucky sperm out of this group of 200 actually penetrates and fertilizes the egg!_
_There were many possibilities, for the humans, for my ancestors and for myself. My existence is a miracle and i will not deny it. I acknowledge the process for my existence and today, i bow to accept the responsibility to take its care. Without a rest, my heart is beating my life. My arteries are carrying the being(blood). My kidneys, my lungs, my liver, my brain, my limbs, my ears, my eyes; yeah, all cells are processing to keep me alive. I will always accept this reality and stay grounded. My useless thoughts won’t define me, for I am bigger than my consciousness. I pay respect to my body, and i will care it properly. I will feed myself with good food and good thought. I will love myself._
