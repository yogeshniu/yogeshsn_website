# Title: Tamor Chisyang Diversion Multipurpose Project - Comprehensive Overview

_Disclaimer: Donot Share !! Use it for study and Project Purpose only. Summarized for 079MSHPE Batch_

**Introduction:**
The Tamor Chisyang Diversion Multipurpose Project is a key initiative aimed at boosting agricultural productivity and providing year-round irrigable facilities in Nepal, particularly in the districts of Morang, Jhapa, and Sunsari. With a focus on harnessing the potential of the Tamor River, the project involves a comprehensive plan for irrigation, hydropower generation, and overall socio-economic development.

**Background:**
Nepal's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, making investments in this sector crucial. The average annual runoff flow in the region is approximately 225 BCM, with 50 BCM originating from seasonal rivers in TERAI. Notably, 80% of this flow occurs during the monsoon months (June to September). The average annual rainfall is 1530 mm, with 80% concentrated in the monsoon season. Out of this, water used by end-users is estimated at 15 BCM, distributed among domestic (3.4%), industrial (0.3%), and agricultural (96.3%) sectors.

**Project Overview:**
The Tamor Chisyang Diversion Multipurpose Project aims to provide year-round irrigable facilities to 107,851 hectares of land. A prefeasibility study, conducted by the Department of Water Resources and Irrigation (DWRI) in June 2020, outlines the key aspects of the project.

**Key Features:**
- The project involves the diversion of released water from the Tamor Storage Hydroelectric Project (TSHEP) through the construction of a re-regulating dam located 10 km downstream of TSHEP tailrace.
- The project site is strategically situated, with a Full Supply Level (FSL) of 550 masl, a Minimum Operating Level (MOL) of 492 masl, and an installed capacity of 45.7 MW. The tailwater level is maintained at 352 masl.
- The dam structure is a rockfill dam with a gated spillway, featuring six vertical axis Francis Turbines for power generation. Water is then discharged back into the Tamor River via three tailrace tunnels.
- A regulating dam of 10m height ensures hourly released water flow regulation.
- The project boasts a gross head of 70.2 m and a net head of 50m, delivering a total energy output of 131.72 GWhr annually.
- Infrastructure includes a barrage with a length of 222m and an FSL of 350masl. A 25.2 km long headrace tunnel connects Lokhara village to the powerhouse in Letang Municipality, Morang.
- The project is located at coordinates 549572.08m E and 2984793.38m N, approximately 25km east of the Koshi Highway from Mulghat.

**Energy and Transmission:**
- The project is anticipated to generate 45.7 MW, producing 131.72 GWhr annually and 189.39 GW hr over its operational lifespan.
- A design discharge of 109.7 m3/s is maintained to ensure optimal energy generation.
- The Damak Substation is crucial for transmitting generated power, connected through a 25km long, 132kV transmission line.

**Geographical and Environmental Context:**
- The project spans the latitude of 26° 23' to 26° 49' N and longitude 87°05' to 87° 49' E, covering Sunsari, Morang, Jhapa in the Koshi Pradesh region.
- The elevation of the project area ranges from 260 to 340 amsl.
- Notable locations in proximity include the East-West Highway, Biratnagar Airport, and towns like Biratnagar, Dharan, Itahari, Urlabari, and Damak.
- The environmental impact assessment (EIA) recommends vegetation clearance, citing the presence of limited residential wildlife species.

**Hydrology and Meteorology:**
- The climate in the region is characterized as Tropical Monsoon to Subtropical, with an average annual precipitation of 2018mm in the command area and 1972mm in the Tamor Watershed.
- Monthly temperature variations range from a mean monthly maximum of 28.1°C to a mean monthly minimum of 16.8°C. Relative humidity fluctuates between 36-42%.
- The project area is fed by 48 local rivers, with an annual flow at the diversion site reaching 8195 MCM. The average flow at the diversion site is approximately 341.38 m3/s, and flood discharge is measured at 7200 m3/s.

**System Development:**
- The project aims to cultivate a Gross Cultivable Area (GCA) of 148,992 Ha, out of which a cultivable command area of 107,851 Ha is targeted. This includes 14,588 Ha of existing irrigation and the addition of 93,262 Ha through the new irrigation system.
- The annual irrigation demand is estimated at 1713.39 MCM, with 184.3 MCM met by local sources. The remaining demand of 1528.69 MCM is intended to be diverted from the Tamor River, fulfilling both irrigation needs and power generation requirements.

**Main Canal Infrastructure:**
- Two main canals, West and East, are planned, covering 40.7 km and 44.6 km in length, respectively. They include numerous road crossings, syphons, and offtakes to ensure efficient water distribution.

**Hydropower Development:**
- The project's headwork is a barrage with a riverbed elevation of 340masl, featuring a side intake with a 350masl FSL, two distilling basins, and a 25.1 km long tunnel with a 7.4 m diameter. A head availability of 50m and a design discharge of 109.7 m3/s contribute to optimal power generation.
- Three Francis turbines, each with 90% efficiency, are integrated with a 150m long penstock pipe. The project includes three synchronous, three-phase generators.
- Transmission infrastructure involves a 25km-long, 132kV line connecting to the Damak Substation.

**Financials and Costing:**
- The total project cost is estimated at NPR 99,21,62,82,275, almost 1 kharba. This translates to a cost per hectare of NPR 263204.54 and a cost per MW of NPR 1549877.
