As I opened my eyes and tried to see,

The Gods were imprisoned, and the demons were free.

I tried to decode what it means,

Dark was the cloud, the world of sins.                      

I wanted to go, they had me frozen,           

I was the target, the spear was thrown.

              

Spear of love, Spear of hate,                                  

Spear of joy, Spear of threat,                                   

Spear of pain, Spear of shame,                         

What was that, I could not combat!

Hapless in his arms, I stood alive.

The Dreary fate, How could I fight?

Now and Then, on a deadly chain,

I wanted to laugh, they escalated pain.

I tried to search, the soul of mine                  

I was the Demon, I needed to shine.

The escape, written in a mystery book,

Is How we look and What we took,

Blessed with fate, the one we choose.
