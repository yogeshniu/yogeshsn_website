# Embracing Nepalese Diversity: A Glimpse into Local Cultures and Celebrations

In the span of a week, I had the incredible opportunity to immerse myself in the rich history, diverse cultures, and enchanting rituals of the Gurung and Rai/Limbu communities in Nepal. On December 26, 2023, a friend and I embarked on a journey to the pilgrimage site of Kirats at Hattiban, Lalitpur, Nepal, to witness the festivals of Chasok Tangnam and Udhauli.

The experience was a feast for the senses as we absorbed the intricacies of their traditional dresses, customs, delectable food, soul-stirring music, and captivating dance performances. As someone raised in the central part of Nepal, this was my first-hand exposure to the vibrant cultures of the Rai and Limbu communities, who predominantly inhabit the hills of Eastern Nepal.

The Kirat community, with a history spanning thousands of years, holds Yalambar, the King of Kirat, in high esteem. Most members of these communities follow a blend of Kirat and Hindu religions, finding complementarity in their practices. Like many Nepalese, they revere nature, believe in the significance of good deeds, and embrace the concepts of heaven and reincarnation.

Upon my arrival in Kathmandu for my engineering studies, I managed to form friendships with individuals from these communities. However, my initial exposure was limited, mostly interacting with urban-based friends with a shallow understanding of their distinct cultures. It wasn't until I watched the movie "Jaari" in April that I delved deeper into the nuances of the Limbu community.

## Lhoshar: A Vibrant Gurung Celebration

Fast forward to the last day of 2023, where I found myself in Tudhikhel, Kathmandu, to witness the Lhoshar celebration of the Gurung community. Unlike my experiences with Rai and Limbu cultures, Gurungs were more familiar, residing near my hometown. Yet, the day held many new revelations.

Prime Minister Parchanda graced the occasion as the chief guest. Various groups of Gurungs from different corners of Nepal showcased their unique dances, styles, dresses, and cultural expressions. The sight of young boys and girls adorned in their traditional dresses was both appealing and attractive. Engaging in conversations about their culture, tasting their traditional foods, and observing their vibrant dances enriched my understanding.


During Lhoshar, Gurung men wear the traditional Bhangra, a white apron, and a Kachhad, a short garment. Gurung women, from children to adolescents, don Ghalek, a velvet blouse, complemented by gold ornaments such as earrings and semi-precious stone necklaces.

The festival is marked by feasting and traditional dances, with homemade Raksi being a central part of the festivities. As we bid farewell to the cat year and welcome the Garuda year, symbolized by a kind of vulture, the Lhoshar celebration encapsulates the spirit of unity, diversity, and cultural richness within the Gurung community.

This journey has not only deepened my appreciation for the diverse cultures within Nepal but has also highlighted the importance of preserving and celebrating these unique traditions that contribute to the country's cultural mosaic.
