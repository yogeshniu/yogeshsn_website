An affectionate girl  
once abandoned by a boy  
started taking all men  
Her enemy , her rivals  
The sweet turns into bitter  
The dreams into darkness  

A daring  lad, in his adventure  
Meet his perfect lass  
They vow to be together  
For rest of all lives  
He was cheated  
He now vows not to love again  
The  vigour decays to lethargy  

A father  hopes his child a best  
Delivers everything, without  eating  
But son grows into unusual  
His dreams and belief  all fall  
His health is supported on pills  

A begger rebuke richer for means  
Wealthy people see slums as  sins  
One god is bigger, than the rest  
The truth I believe, I am best  

The world revolves around other  
Who cares himself but further ?.
