# Reflecting on 2023: A Year of Growth and Resilience

2023 emerged as a pivotal year in my life, marked by a myriad of choices, trade-offs, and compromises. It became a defining moment, propelling me to face challenges, prove my worth, and put in considerable effort.

## Embracing Opportunities and Academic Pursuits

The year commenced with fresh opportunities, leading me to various parts of Nepal to refine my engineering skills. By the end of April, a significant decision awaited me as I joined the Master's program at Pulchowk Campus. Opting to stay in my home country over moving abroad was a tough compromise, yet one that I made with conviction.

## A Year of Exploration, Personal Development, and New Habits

Throughout the year, I forged new friendships, traveled extensively, explored diverse cuisines, celebrated festivals, cared for my mother post-surgery, and dedicated time to self-improvement. The last two months proved particularly productive, marked by daily running, month-long meditation in December, and holistic development of body, mind, and soul. Engaging with enriching literature, meeting inspiring individuals, acquiring new skills, and redefining the meaning of life were integral to this transformative period.

## Commitments for 2024: Discipline, Learning, and Balanced Living

I firmly believe in the power of discipline and hard work. In the coming year, I commit to waking up before sunrise, running regularly, introspecting, reading enriching literature, living in the present, and diligently working towards my goals.

### Priorities for 2024:

- **Screen Time Reduction:** A 40% decrease compared to the previous year.
- **Physical Well-being:** Emphasis on good diet, modest exercise, and ample rest.
- **Intellectual Pursuits:** Reading two impactful books each month, starting with "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" by Robert Sapolsky and "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" in January.
- **Focused Learning:** Prioritizing research, programming, and career-oriented skills, i will listen more podcasts 

I recognize the need for a better plan for effective implementation, and I am committed to finalizing it within this week. Ongoing Chinese language classes will continue to broaden my horizons.
I reject the notion of constant happiness or comfort, viewing them as myths perpetuated by a lazy soul. Conscious of my mortality, I aspire to live fully each day, becoming a better version of myself.

At the end of this week, I will present a comprehensive plan for my routine on this website.
Wishing everyone good health. God Bless You.
