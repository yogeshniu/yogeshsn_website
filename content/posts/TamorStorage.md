## Evolution of Tamor Storage HydroElectric Project
In 1985, the [**Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)**](https://openjicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12147328_02.pdf) proposed a substantial 696MW hydroelectric project on the Tamor River, involving the construction of a 153-meter tall dam. However, the government at that time did not express much interest in pursuing the project. Moving ahead to 2012, the [**Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)**](https://www.nea.org.np/) filed an application with the [**Department of Electricity Development (DoED)**](http://www.doed.gov.np/) following a study conducted by JICA. The aim was to obtain a survey license for the project.

Initially, the DoED showed reluctance, expressing concerns that the proposed hydropower project might adversely affect existing ventures such as the [**38MW Kabeli A**](https://www.bpc.com.np/projects/kabeli-a-hydro-electric-project) and [**22MW Lower Hewakhola**](https://www.mhnl.com.np/hewa-project/)which already held electricity generation licenses. In response to this, NEA adjusted its approach and applied for a survey license for the construction of a scaled-down [_200MW project_](http://www.nepalenergyforum.com/tamor-hydro-project-capacity-reduced-to-200-mw/) on the same Tamor River. This modified proposal was eventually approved. Subsequent studies conducted on the project hinted that it could be upgraded to generate a more substantial 762MW of electricity. In August 2013, the Department of Electricity Development extended a survey license to NEA, enabling various studies for the development of the 200MW project on the Tamor River. The subsequent findings suggested the project's potential for an even higher capacity.

On January 19, 2020, a significant development occurred with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Office of the Investment Board Nepal (OIBN), Power Construction Corporation of China (PCCCL), and Hydroelectricity Investment and Development Company Ltd. (HIDCL). The MoU outlined plans for a detailed feasibility study (DFS) for the Tamor Hydropower Project, which was now envisaged at a capacity of 756MW.

This ambitious project was first identified in the master plan prepared by JICA in 1985. It is situated on the Lambhu Khola of the Tamor River, located at a Latitude of 27°03'11.9"N and Longitude of 87°32'56.5"E, spanning Tehrathum and Panchthar districts in Province 1. The project area, approximately 650 km east of Kathmandu, is accessible via Mechi Highway from Jhapa, Puspalal Highway from Panchthar, and Tamor Corridor from Dharan to Taplejung.

The Tamor river basin originates in Mount Kanchanjunga and flows to form the Saptakoshi river, eventually merging with the Ganga River in India en route to the Indian Ocean. The Tamor Storage project holds significant potential, especially for Eastern Nepal, promising to reduce dependency on electricity from other provinces and contribute to local economic prosperity.
NEA's preliminary report suggests that the geographical location, social impact assessment, and environmental conditions are suitable for the construction of the project. However, the presence of two hydropower projects upstream poses a major obstacle, as these projects would likely be submerged if the Tamor Storage project moves forward.

According to Baburam Bhardwai who is a  Chief Technical Officer (CTO) at Hydro Venture Pvt Ltd, "Tamor storage project (752 MW)is far more attractive and economicaly/financially viable multi-purpose project of Nepal. This project should have been implemented for generation, irrigation and recreation benefits long back. It is already late; sooner the better."  Civil engineer Kushal Basnet, in an article for myRepublica, highlighted that the generated power from the Tamor Hydropower Project could be exported to either India or Bangladesh. This export could be facilitated through a transmission line constructed from the project site to Inaruwa via the Kakarbhitta border, with the construction cost potentially lower due to the project's proximity to the market.

## Project Details
The Tamor Storage Hydroelectric Project, identified as a Storage type hydropower initiative with a capacity of 756 MW according to the NEA feasibility study in 2016, holds significant promise for the energy landscape in Nepal. Situated in Province 1 across Tehrathum and Panchthar districts, approximately 650 km east from Kathmandu, this venture is a focal point for sustainable energy development in the region. The closest town to the dam site is Myanglung Bazaar, accessible through a 20km drive on an earthen road.
