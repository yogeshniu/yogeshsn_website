      <description>Exploring the Use of self in Python with Reservoir Planning In this blog, we will explore how to use the self function in Python by taking an example from reservoir planning. By the end of this post, we will learn to create a class, define its behavior, and operate it using simple Python code.
What is a Class in Python? A class in Python helps us create complex data structures that can contain both data and functions (also called methods) that work on that data.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we will be working with streamflow data and using the pandas and matplotlib libraries to analyze and visualize the data.
Streamflow Data We will start by generating random streamflow data using the numpy library. We will create an array of 365 random numbers between 5 and 15, representing the streamflow for each day of the year.
num_days = 365 streamflow = np.random.uniform(low=5,high=15,size=num_days) Creating a Date Range Next, we will create a date range for the data using the pandas library.</description>

      <description>SciPy is an open-source Python library that provides various mathematical algorithms and functions for tasks such as numerical integration, optimization, interpolation, and linear algebra. One of its key modules, scipy.optimize, offers optimization routines including linear programming.
Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical method used to determine the best possible outcome, typically defined by an objective function, given a set of linear constraints. It has applications in various fields such as economics, engineering, and operations research.</description>

      <description>Mr. Bharat Raj Pandey is a senior engineer at Hydro Consult Engineering Limited. Today, he shared valuable lessons in our hydropower engineering class, focusing on hydro headworks design.
The initial step involves a topographical survey, requiring a D card from the survey department of Nepal to obtain XYZ coordinates. Control points are established through surveying techniques like triangulation to create a detailed map at a 1:1000 scale.
The importance of a detailed map lies in understanding the depth and width needed for foundation work during hydropower headworks construction.</description>

      <description>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), formerly known as Millennium Dam and sometimes referred to as Hidese Dam, is a gravity dam situated on the Blue Nile River in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region of Ethiopia. The primary purpose of this dam is to generate electricity, addressing Ethiopiaâ€™s energy shortage and facilitating electricity exports to neighboring countries. The initial planned generation capacity of 5250 MW was later increased to 6450 MW with various adjustments made over time.</description>

      <description>Department of Energy Development (DoED) Nepal Guideline In accordance with the Guidelines for the Study of Hydropower Projects 2018, the DoED specifies that a compensation flow (10% of the lowest monthly flow or the amount recommended by IEE/EIA study) should be released downstream. This should be deducted from the available dry season flows for the computation of energy estimates.
The government of Nepal plans to harness 10,000 MW by 2026 through various projects.</description>
