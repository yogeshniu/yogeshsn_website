      <description>Humanity is not a new word; we all know about it. It is a quality a rational thinker possesses which distinguish himself as a kind, a non-harming and loving being. But is it that simple? NO, I don’t think so. Humanity is a complex issue because it involves thoughts and emotions. The word derived from Latin humanitas which means “human nature, kindness”. Some argue Humanity is the human race, while other define qualities such as love, compassion and even creativity, in understanding humanity.</description>
